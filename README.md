# RUNcode
Code for paper "Estimating Causal Effects in Studies of Human Brain Function: New Models, Methods and Estimands"

The code consists of MATLAB code implementing the methods from the paper. It requires two additional toolboxes that are freely available, namely SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/) and the Canlab Core tools (https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore/). The code can be used to reproduce all figures in the paper. Run the file RUNcode.m to reproduce the full analysis and create figures. 

The GitHub page also contains the data sets needed to run the analysis.
